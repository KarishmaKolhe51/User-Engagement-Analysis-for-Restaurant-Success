# User-Engagement-Analysis-for-Restaurant-Success

## About YELP
Yelp is a web and mobile paltform that functions as a crowd-sourced local business review site. Users can submit reviews, photos, and tips about businesses, while also browsing information and ratings left by others.

## Problem Statement 
In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. Utilizing the Yelp dataset, this project aims to investigate the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, and check-ins) and business success matrics (review count, ratings) for restaurants.
